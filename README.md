# authentication-basics

### This is my first authentication project with passportJS. This is a simple project where you can create a user with a username and a simple text password. Then we can log in using that password and it will show a welcome message along with the name of the user. 
### Also it has a log out functionality to it.
### In this project I also learned to store passwords in a secure way using a library called bcrypt.
